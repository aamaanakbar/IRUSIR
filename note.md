IRUSIR - Updated with Custom Loss and Evaluation
This repository is an updated version of the original StyleGAN2-ADA. The updates include:

Custom loss implementation.
Automatic file handling for different image formats (jpg, JPG, png).
Improved evaluation code.
Steps to Set Up and Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stylegan2-ada-updated.git
cd stylegan2-ada-updated
2. Create and Set Up the Environment
Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv stylegan-env
source stylegan-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure that the required libraries, such as PyTorch, CUDA, and other dependencies, are properly installed. This is crucial for the successful execution of StyleGAN2-ADA.

3. Additional Library Installations
If any additional libraries are needed, install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r additional_requirements.txt
4. Use Pretrained Model and Data
Import your pretrained model file (renamed to match the expected format in the code).
Place your cotton crop images in the respective folder as required for training or evaluation.
Make sure all your image file extensions (jpg, JPG, png) are consistent. You can rename them to JPG to avoid any issues.

bash
Copy code
# Example to rename all images to JPG format
rename 's/\.[jpg|png]/.JPG/' *.jpg *.png
5. Run the Model
To run the model using the provided scripts:

bash
Copy code
# Run the author's updated version
python run_auth.py

# Run the custom version with your loss function
python run_myloss.py
You can switch between the two versions depending on your requirements. Both versions are available in the repository.

6. File Updates and Customization
run_auth.py: This file contains the author's original updated code.
run_myloss.py: This file incorporates the custom loss function based on your preferences.
7. Loss Function in the Robust Unsupervised Folder
Ensure that you have incorporated the correct loss code in the robust_unsupervised/ folder. Replace the existing loss code with your custom implementation to align with run_myloss.py.

8. Evaluation
The evaluation code has also been updated. Use it for testing and validating your model's performance on the dataset.






# This repository provides an enhanced version of the StyleGAN2-ADA project with the following improvements:

Custom loss function incorporated.
Full support for 1024x1024 resolution images.
Automatic handling of image formats (jpg, JPG, png).
Updated evaluation process using IQA PyTorch with LPIPS, LPIPS-VGG, and FID scores.
Modified CLI file for seamless execution based on project needs.
Key Features
1024x1024 Image Resolution: The project now fully supports high-resolution images. Ensure your dataset is resized to 1024x1024 pixels before training.
Image Quality Assessment: We use IQA PyTorch for evaluation, including LPIPS, LPIPS-VGG, and FID scores, ensuring robust quality metrics for generated images.




























1. first clone the repository
2. now create and env and install the requisite of stylegan2 ada 
3. now install some important libraries as per this repo 
4. now i imported pretrained file(remaned as per code.) from my trained stylegan2 ada and also put the cotton crop images into the respective folders. 
5. run the model as per instructions.
6. ALSO look at the file name ex jpg or JPG or png such type of problem , here i changed all name as JPG .

this is the updated code so it will run without any external command for all the task.
it has also updated eval code.






updated original code.(there is two python file are present like run_auth.py it is author updated code and other is run_myloss.py it is my incorporated code) so according to your requirements replace that code in run.py file same in robust_unsupervised folder do it for loss .
